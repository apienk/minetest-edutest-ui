# minetest-edutest-ui
This mod provides user interface extensions for the MinetestEDU/EDUtest project. It depends on [my fork](https://github.com/apienk/edutest-chatcommands) of `edutest-chatcommands` mod by Isidor Zeuner.

## Mission statement

The goal of the MinetestEDU or EDUtest project is to make Minetest easy to use by a teacher in a classroom environment. The original idea was described in [this Minetest forum thread](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=11452). The project is a collection of mods (a modpack) that allows teachers to feel in control of the students while in game.

**Note 1:** Buttons will only show up if optionally `their respective mods` are loaded

**Note 2:** The formspec tabs will only show up if player has `instructor` privilege

## Installation
- download the repository as ZIP: https://github.com/apienk/minetest-edutest-ui/archive/master.zip
- unpack ZIP to your mods folder: `.minetest/mods/` on Linux or `minetest-install-directory/mods/` on Windows
- rename folder `minetest-edutest-ui-master` to `edutest-ui`
- enable the mod in your `world.mt` (add line `load_mod_edutest_ui=true`) or using the game GUI
- don't forget to install my fork of `edutest-chatcommands` mod (link below) as `edutest-ui` depends on it
- for complete functionality also install mods: `areas`, `jailbox`, `teaching` (preferably my fork, link below), `freeze`, `invmanagement`, `bookmarks_gui` (preferably my fork, link below), `invisible`
- to play as teacher grant yourself all privileges (type `/grantme all` in game)
- students don't need to be assigned any privileges to be affected by `all students` commands, just leave default (`shout` and `interact`)

## To do
- [ ] ask questions in formspec and aggregate answers
- [ ] student groups
- [ ] written assignments
- [ ] internationalization
- [ ] reward system
- [ ] controlled PvP

## Other useful mods to use in classroom
- my fork of `wardrobe` mod: https://github.com/apienk/minetest-mod-wardrobe (adds a nice GUI)
- my fork of `display_modpack`: https://github.com/apienk/display_modpack (adds Unicode support and new character textures for many languages)

## Some lesson ideas

### Mathematics:
- build a city of buildings and ask students to calculate total blocks per building
- make students build a multiplication table (pyramid) from blocks
- give resources and make students estimate or calculate the number of goods that can be crafted from them (division with remainder)
- set up math problems from `teaching` blocks and make students compete by trying to find and solve; reward them with diamonds or alike
- calculate height of buildings using Tales equation

### Science:
- build a representation of the Solar System using real size and distance proportions (`worldedit` mod might be handy)
- experiment with conservation of energy by building a rollercoaster (requires `carts` mod)
- model an atom
- put students in an environment with very limited resources and discuss decisions that would lead to long-term survival
- renewable vs. non-renewable energy sources (requires `mesecons` or `technic` mod)

### Languages:
- set up a contest where students or student groups compete by building words from letter blocks
- recreate and play a situation from a piece of literature or movie
